Niblite:With its glowing body, the Niblite is who you go to when the Cove starts to turn dark. Its bulb is said to be able to glow so bright, it can light up the entire Island! Though its as bright can be, it provides no warmth for the other Monsters.. Note that the surges going through its body from its Bulb keep the Niblites heart beating, and if that runs out, its gone for good. || Concepts: MSMMike || Rendering: Slimer || Animations: Slimer ||
Pitchfall:From their witty jokes to their excellent singing skills, Pitchfalls are among the most cheerful Monsters you'll ever meet! These spring beans begin life in pods within the Deciduous Trees of Whisperwood Grove. Once fully grown, they shed their age-bound shell and bring their, shall we say, unique voice wherever they go - whether floating through Broken Reality or living in an everlasting Cove.
Shadolt:Almost all shadolts are born with two instinctual abilities, taxidermy and orb finding. Why taxidermy would be such an innate ability they need is very simple, shadolts are born with no true physical form, so they search for animals in which to use as such, when they find what they are looking for, dead or alive, they quickly plant themselves inside and through various means, which, are little too graphic to describe, prop the corpse into the suitable shape with other stuff that make the corpse not rot, making it last longer and not smell. As for the orb finding, which incidentally gives the reason why dolt is apart of these species name, are orbs they find, which while looking very much like the very rare and valuable currency used for trade, these are nonetheless false orbs. However being such an instinctual trait these species have ( along with a tad bit of greed) deny the fact of it's false-itivity, in true belief they are indeed the valuable orbs. Now as for where these species keeps on finding these false orbs may be the same reason why you see most shadolts trapped in the ice of frozen cove.
Wallagumper:Listen closely and you might hear the distinctive calls and wails of the Wallagumper echoing through the Cove! This peculiar Monster, said to hail from an Ancient Village, has one particularly odd quirk - it becomes strangely agitated at the mere sight of a goose. Who knows?
Potaschpell:What happens when you mix every Potion imaginable into a single brew? The Potaschpell is living proof! Legend tells of an evil Witch who, while brewing a Potion to seize control of an Enchanted Kingdom, added far too many ingredients to her concoction. To her amazement, a pair of glowing green eyes emerged from the mixture, and thus the Potaschpell was born!
Stitchum:Recently freed from their Icy Prison, the Stitchum bears a peculiar curse - forever bound by Magical Strings it once tried desperately to break. Rather than fight its fate, the Stitchum discovered that its binding silk can create beautiful music when plucked. Now it spends its days mastering these restraints, though it still gives them an occasional tug, just to check.
Jelteejug:SPLASH! SPLASH! Here comes the astounding Jelteejug! Similar to all 'drinkable' Monsters in the Elemental World, its body contains Toxic Juice that no one should taste, for the benefit of both parties. This Monsters true value lies in its role as the Cove's Guardian. Thanks to its ability to breathe underwater, the Jelteejug regularly catches fish to feed its fellow Monsters.
Rib-Eat:Known as the Glutton of the Frozen Cove, Rib-Eat descends from one of the Elemental Worlds mightiest predators. This Monsters excessive appetite has created its own unique gravitational pull - treats orbit around it! Despite barely being able to move, Rib-Eat never goes hungry as snacks quite literally revolve around Rib-Eat, causing not so occasional food shortages.
Chygll:Rumored to be a creation of the great TinkerTonker itself, the mechanical marvel known as Chygll began its life in the TinkerTonkers workshop, however after the Gearsnap Ziggazap incident, it found itself abandoned in an Icy Cave beneath the surface. Adapting to its new environment, Chygll collected gold and gems during its subterranean explorations until an unfortunate trip-wire sent it tumbling straight into the Frozen Cove.
Lumintipus:A Cyber-Squid native to the Frozen Depths, Lumintipus is the only Monster capable of leaving the Cove at will. Its Human World squid-like form is adorned with Ice Crystals and a Golden Shell at its center, wading beautiful light shows in the waters. Despite their ability to freely roam the depths, each Lumintipus chooses to stay in the Cove, having found something more valuable than freedom - a home among friends.
Djyeti:The fabled Djyeti draws equal measures of fear and respect from those who speak its name. Though drawn to the Frozen Cove by an insatiable hunger for treasure, this massive Monster now spends its days crafting Ice Sculptures. Don't let the facade fool you - beneath that bulk beats a surprisingly warm heart.
Escarmor:Once a lost gastropod, Escarmor found its way to the TinkerTonkers workshop and left as something more - a machine complete with upgrades and weaponry. After the TinkerTonkers disappearance, this wanderer drifted through Frozen Wastes until fate, and also melting ice sent it to the Cove.
ToTempo:ToTempo stands as the perfect example of cooperation. Pod provides the foundation and nutrients, Peaks keeps watch for threats, while Pog and Puff - well, no one quite knows what they do, but they're essential parts of this Totem all the same.
Musharp:Deep in the Fungal Forests of Pholowah, Musharps craft their own instruments from psychically shaped secretions. These unusual Monsters nurture their strings, tending to them like delicate Garden Vines. Once matured, the strings resonate with their shared Psychic Energy - some say they can even hear whispers of the Forest in their sleep.
Timbalog:No one really knows how an ent could of ended up in such a frigid environment, yet here we are! The markings on this timbalog, however, are special, rumoured to of been painted by a long forgotten civilisation.
Truphly:After hearing myths and fables regarding treasures deep in the Frozen Depths, Truphly knew that it had to capitalise while it could. Bearing a miner's helmet and a pickaxe, Truphly began buzzing down the shafts leading deep into the depths. Unfortunately, this monster was caught in an avalanche and left trapped on the Frozen Cove.
Zoombah:Deep below the surface, within the monster graveyard, one of our Employees had went missing. We haven't found him since, but last time someone was sent to find him, this is what we found. Unfortunately, Zoombah breaks any ground that it touches, as it creates a hole in the floor, and it always takes so long to patch upâ€¦ Why must they do this to us?
EliDii:The foundational element of light is reflected greatly in the small glowing creature EliDii! It's first appearance in the Elemental World dates back to it's corresponding Astral. They dreamt of a little light buddy to accompany their voyage across the Novusatus, but unfortunately it's elemental power was too weak. This lead the powerful Astral to leave their small pet to voyage the world alone.
Knockrock:The Knockrock is quite the mysterious monster, yet it is rumored to have been created by an ancient monster civilisation as an idol. After the civilisation died out, the Knockrock was left abandoned in a cave. Eventually, it was rediscovered by archaelogists and turned into a decoration for their island. However, when this island began to drift away into the Eternal Void, it was rescued by the god of the Monster Realm, and it's inhabitants were taken to it's pocket dimension!
Breeze:Breeze, what a wonderful flowy monster. From flying along the Skyline City in their early years, the Breeze sure knows how to go with the flow. The colours from the breeze originate from their creator who chose them as their own! With being the single of wind, they do know how to fly, but with such a hard power to hold, parts of their dress tends to float away. Luckily at some point they finally become one again! The responsible role of the Breeze is to sustain levelled air speeds so any monster can live within the conditions of any chosen environment.
Mesmur:TBA
GnailDwuhm:GnailDwhums are a unique species of monsters, who tend to live underground in groups. Although it may not seem it, these gastropods are extraordinary architects! Despite appearing blind, these snails use their telekentic abilities to see, as well as manipulate the rocks and rubble around it to it's will!
Ztarrgaes:A rabbit forged from the collision of two stars, the Ztarrgaes is a true reflection of the Galactic Paradise. With cheeks adorned with sparkling diamonds, and wings glowing with a neon azure, Ztarrgaes is sure to leave any monster starstruck. Better yet, the angelic calls echoing from this mon relax surrounding monsters and help them get to sleep!
G-Stapahn:This monster of divine origin, here to serenade with it's calming "steel" pan rings? The rings this monster utilizes for it's sound are made from the very gilded gates of the Astral Realm, giving it's sound a holy touch of some sorts. Tales have been told that this monster originated as one of the many stars in the Great Cosmos, it has a great sense of direction, and is very up-to-date on the happenings around the islands, making it great for leading monsters wherever they need to go. It acts as both a light to your feet and a GPS, talk about godsend.
Carcoal:TBA
Triceptic:Woah this little guy sure is cute! The Triceptic loves sing it's song wherever destiny happens to bring them. How does such a cool sound get produced by that tail? Now this is a funny one! Triceptic produces its sound by using it's element of Magic to vibrate the tail at speeds where it appears that the tail is not moving at all! This silly little fella always laughs at the smallest things but to a point where it's very concerning... but who cares? They are super fun!
Nightae:Is it a bird? Is it a plane? We aren't actually sure what the Nightae is, but the leading theory is that in an old world, the nonchalant Nightae was a prominent archaelogist, using it's many floating hands to excavate historical sites of the Elemental World. Sometimes, the Nightae may sneak off with an artifact that it has discovered, so as to hold a large collection of uncovered treasures.
Hmhph:Whilst humming the lovely song of the paradise, Hmhphs love to energize themselves by staring into the light of the portals. Each Hmhph is equipped with the most powerful lenses the EB world has ever witnessed! After a long day of humming away, the Hmhph loves to wind down by shutting its eye module to obsorb the surrounding light. The orgins of the Hmhph are certainly questionable to say the least. This specific branch of the Huum family originated from the vast plains that surround the steel sanctuary. From the families roots, things were not easy so they sought refuge to the large Travelling Workshop, otherwise known as the TinkerTonker. This mighty being would equip each Hmhph with the power to obsorb and release electricity! With this mighty power came its strong buzzy sound that would help to fill the air of the Galactic Paradise.
Xylowah:Xylowah is a very interesting monster, in that this monster absolutely loves cheese, doesn't matter what kind, it will eat cheese. This love of cheese has even altered even its body structure, with it having a very bulky chest (it kinda looks like an apron). This "chest bulk" actually helps the mon store various cheeses, not only that but also acts like a melting pot, melting all the various cheeses into basically one big soup, so it can regurgitate the cheese to use as fondue... or just to eat again.
Pengwip:Pengwips hail from the Arctic regions of the Elemental World, and use their popping out eyeballs to help spot prey. These monsters are amazing swimmers, and can withstand freezing cold temperatures with ease. Unfortunately, this leads to some ending up incased in ice, after not realising how cold it is!
Mt'Draum:TBA
Hendbubet:Blah, blah, and also blah! The Hendbubet is certainly an interesting monster, like seriously when was the last time a monster had THREE mouths! This monster definitely holds the title for the boss of the Galactic Paradise because these three chatty talkers sure know how to keep the monsters in check. The Hendbubet helps govern the air around the paradise to make sure it stays... a paradise! Since the blackhole came to swallow the island whole, Hendbubet had come here to help keep the monsters calm and to let them know help was on the way, and there was it... The Monster God!
Shrine:Introducing the glorious Shrine! Each shrine is a testament to each island's Astral where many monsters from around come to worship and present offerings. 
Hoo-Ha:Other monsters find the Tee-Kii very Odd, despite being the embodiment of Fire, it's often very kind and considerate, and not just because it can't do anything with the stubby body it possesses, though, that hasn't stopped monsters from thinking up rumours. The biggest of which is it was once a powerful God, that grew so jealous of all the other God's voices, that it ate them.
SnipSnap:Can you hear the Snippity-Snap of the SnipSnap? Native to the TinkerTonker, they sure are prepared to take upon anything... yes, I mean anything. This steel-cored soul painted a happy-face on its frontal lobe to hide how they truly feel... AMAZING! The SnipSnap comes equipped with two SnipSnappers, as they call it. They use their god-given tools to... I donâ€™t know, they really donâ€™t have a purpose!
Laphight:Known to be a thrifty character, this creature has been said to steal the voices of monsters, in the form of a glowing yellow ball. Of course, these are all works of fiction that the Water Elementals have thought up.. they never seemed to like fire all too well. In reality, the ball is simply the monster's very own voice, said to imbue any who hear it with a warm fuzzy feeling. these are often favoured to be therapists, but they prefer to work on their hobby in glass blowing.
Gynth:From laying out in the oasis for too long before their god-gifted repairs, Gynth's body started to fall further from homeostasis. That was before the TinkerTonker found them. He thought Gynth needed some essential upgrades to it's respiratory system, but the TinkerTonker wanted to not only fix Gynth but grant him a glowing gift. After consulting with the Astral of Light, permission was now granted to send such powers to this weak being. The Gynth would soon be able to illuminate it's head producing a low chilling synthetic sound to clear any gunk from the Gynth's lungs. This replaces Gynth's need for any sort of hydration making the desert life infinitely easier!
Wallenchump:Although being basically the same species as a Wallagumper,  "Wallanoids" do possess a hierarchy within their species, with Wallenchumps being in the higher ranks... despite their short stature. Almost all Wallenchumps hold an almost comical disdain and disgust to lower ranked beings. And while you may find Wallagumpers living in village, Wallenchumps prefer to live in  more sophisticated environments, like the city, and rarely ever stepping foot elsewhere.... besides that time a Wallenchump went to and sent a village of Wallagumpers to go harvest ice for their drinks. Along with their higher ranks, Wallenchump's also possess a bird, the only thing that they seem to give unconditional love too. This bird get past down from generation to generation, now how is that? Well from what it seems, the bird possess a phoenix like ability to be reborn, though from the birds looks its clearly not a phoenix... we think.
Stump:Here comes the powerful Stump! Equipped with two iron-crafted hands ready to puncture the ground, Stump surely knows how to protect itâ€™s homeland. After many years, friends of the stump had started to draw pictures on him, trying to connect the dots of an unresolved story... From the disappearance of the Stumpâ€™s very own cousin! This story still has yet to find an exact answer...
Roboe:Roboes have a fairly high tolerance to heat, though they also have a heated core, so overheating can be a problem. So a way the Roboes release the excess heat is from their crowned nose, doing this also produces a beautiful noise (though this doesn't really seem to suite it's stern face). And because of this heat tolerance, a Roboes main specialty/job is to work around the more heat intensive areas of TinkerTonker, making extra sure everything's in a shipshape condition. Though, this is not necessarily needed since TinkerTonker is more then self-sufficient to keep it's robotic body well maintained. Because of this, it's unsure whether Roboes are purely robotic beings created by TinkerTonker for this purpose or monsters that were given these "god-given upgrades" and felt indebted to them offering to services TinkerTonker . Though because of all the intense heat Roboes indure, their metal shell are fairly malleable from time to time.... I hope no one tries to stomp on their back.
Volkeyno:Formed from the depths of Novusatus' biggest volcano, Volkeyno retains that fiery appearance! Though this monster lacks the element of Rock, the formation of it's stone like surface is still possible. This monster sure is a bug guy, but with a big body coems a big heart! Now to that small little keyboard engraved in their arm, this device helps carm his nerves so he does not erupt!
Grouchpouch:Grouchpouch's have a very motherly nature and will almost always be seen tendign and caring to the little colourful creatures called Nerpops. Nerpops, adorable as they are, have no real natural instincts and will almost always perish in the wild. A grouchpouch will most likely start taking in Nerpops after their own young king is old enough and leaves to fend for it's own. The Grouchpouch gives its newly taken-in Nerpops food, shelter, and everything needed to survive. Now. while the may seem like a one sided-relationship where the Nerpops get all the benefits and the Grouchpouch gets nothing, this is far from the truth. The Nerpops allow the Grouchpouch to not only express it's motherly nature after their young kin is gone, but they also provide mental health for the Grouchpouch from the mental anguish of it's kin no longer being with them.
Glockensteila:Picture this; a land devoid of life, a giant mechanical form walks across the horizon, and a small monster is jumping high into the air, snatching dying stars into little glass bottles. This is the daily routine of the Glockensteila. But what does it do with the contained star remains? it re-ignites the fading sun by smashing them against it's spikes, teh friction causes the star to refrom and shine as bright as ever, though not for long. But it does't bring the monster any less joy to see the spark of life glimmer once again. Maybe this world can be fixed.
Nutz N' Boltz:One might see this majestic creature leaping out of the dunes that the great TinkerTonker frequently travels. However, on rare occasions, where one becomes brave enough, they will sneak their way onto the great clockwork beast. Whether they are lured by the calming yet upbeat melody coming from atop the carapace of the Mecha-Machine, or simply like the sound metal makes when agitated, they collect up any scrap they can get their hands on and make their way to the top to join in on the symphonic rhythm of the steel island song. Even stowaways are stowed-together on the TinkerTonker.
Quad:Quad
PileOfCrates:This is just a pile of crates.
ScavengerDroneLandingPad:It's a scavenger drone on a landing pad.
PhotophobicLamppost:Panic lamp
EyeOfPanicMon:SPooky
Oven:Want a snack? Try the oven! This mechanical device developed by the Astrals instantly converts gold into food!
Behdumn:The glorious Behdumn is one of the most powerful creatures in all of the Elemental World! Using Astral Power imbued upon it, it is able to change the sounds of other monster's to it's very own voice!
